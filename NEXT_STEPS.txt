================================================================================
                             WHAT TO DO NOW
================================================================================

The DEPLOY_ANDROID.bat script has been UPDATED!

It now searches for adb.exe automatically in common locations.

================================================================================
                          OPTION 1 (Recommended)
================================================================================

Try the deployment again:

1. Make sure your phone is plugged in via USB
2. Double-click: DEPLOY_ANDROID.bat

The updated script should now:
   - Search for adb.exe in common locations
   - Find it even if it's not in PATH
   - Deploy to your phone

If this works, you're done! ðŸŽ‰

================================================================================
                          OPTION 2 (If it fails)
================================================================================

Close Cursor completely and reopen it:

1. Close Cursor IDE completely
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Reopen Cursor
4. Double-click: DEPLOY_ANDROID.bat

This ensures the new PATH set by SETUP_ADB_PATH.bat is loaded.

================================================================================
                        OPTION 3 (Manual Fallback)
================================================================================

If it still doesn't work, find adb.exe manually:

1. Open File Explorer
2. Search for "adb.exe"
3. Note the full path (e.g., C:\path\to\platform-tools\adb.exe)
4. Edit: DEPLOY_ANDROID.bat
5. Find this line: set "ADB_CMD=adb"
6. Change to: set "ADB_CMD=C:\path\to\platform-tools\adb.exe"
7. Save and try again

================================================================================

Next: Try deploying with the updated DEPLOY_ANDROID.bat script!
